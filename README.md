### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my github profile.

I am a former nuclear operator turned full-stack web developer who is never afraid of learning new skills.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a football 🏈 pick-em app with a twist 🌪️
- 🌱 I'm currently learning ASP.NET 🌐 and Entity Framework 🛢
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting/fun web development projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with dotnet
- 💬 Ask me about nuclear power as a solution to global warming
- 📫 How to reach me: [email](mailto:thadcole@duck.com)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: The Washington Capitals logo uses a hockey stick as the letter `T`; I personally would have picked the `L` to be a hockey stick 🤷
